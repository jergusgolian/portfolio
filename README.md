# Backstory
I created, or started working on this project in the start of the 2025/2026 school year. There was more than one reason. But the main driver was that i was basically addicted to social media. So, i started thinking what can i do instea of scrolling instagram. And this seemed like the ideal solution. So i started working on it. I published it on github mainly because i didnt know, where to host it. I found github and i told myself, why no make it open-sourced. So i did.

> [!TIP]
> This is hobby project, so it might happen, that i will forget about it. Mayby it's already forgotten.
